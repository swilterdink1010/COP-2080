# ============================================================================
# Step 1: Create and switch to a new branch for homework
# ============================================================================
git checkout -b homework/Cannonball
# Comment: -b creates a NEW branch called "homework/Cannonball" (only use -b once)
#          Automatically switches you to this new branch
#          You're now working in an isolated branch (won't affect main)

# ============================================================================
# Step 2: Clone the homework repository into current directory
# ============================================================================
git clone https://github.com/fpunavarro/L09HW_Cannonball.git
# Comment: Downloads the homework starter code from GitHub
#          Creates a folder called "L09HW_Cannonball" in current directory
#          This folder has its own .git directory (we'll remove it next)

# ============================================================================
# Step 3: Remove the .git directory from cloned repository
# ============================================================================
rm -rf L09HW_Cannonball/.git
# Comment: -r = recursive (deletes folder and all contents)
#          -f = force (no confirmation prompt)
#          Removes git history from the cloned code
#          Now it's just regular files, not a separate git repository
#          This prevents "git repository inside git repository" conflicts

# ============================================================================
# Step 4: Stage all new files in your repository
# ============================================================================
git add .
# Comment: . = current directory and everything below it
#          Stages the L09HW_Cannonball folder and all its contents
#          Files are now ready to be committed to YOUR repository

# ============================================================================
# Step 5: Commit the homework starter code
# ============================================================================
git commit -m "created new branch Cannonball"
# Comment: -m = message (inline commit message)
#          Creates a commit with all the staged files
#          Saves this snapshot in your repository's history

# ============================================================================
# Step 6: Push the new branch to GitHub
# ============================================================================
git push -u origin homework/Cannonball
# Comment: -u = set upstream (links local branch to remote branch)
#          origin = your GitHub repository
#          homework/Cannonball = the branch name on GitHub
#          After this, future pushes just need "git push"

# ============================================================================
# Step 7: Navigate into the homework directory
# ============================================================================
cd L09HW_Cannonball
# Comment: Changes your working directory into the homework folder
#          All following commands will run inside this folder

# Step 8: Install uv (Python package manager)
# ============================================================================
pip3 install uv

I notice you mentioned new instructions were added between steps 7 and 8, but the document you shared doesn't appear to include them — the content jumps from step 7 directly to step 8 (which was originally step 8). Could you share the new instructions you'd like inserted there? I'll renumber everything accordingly.

renumber the instructions. match formatting. Start with this file:    then add these steps between step 7 and 8:

It looks like the new steps to insert between 7 and 8 didn't come through — your message appears to have been cut off after "add these steps between step 7 and 8:". Could you paste the new steps you'd like inserted?

python3 -m venv .venv
Answer no to prompt for setting to workspace folder
ls -a # to confirm .venv exists
source .venv/bin/activate
